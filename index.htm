<h3>Headers</h3>
<p>Headers are nice and simple u just put in < h > and end with < / h > no spaces!
<p>Now trying to remeber it is easy to just think of H and think of head and think if header ;-;</p>

<h3>Paragraph</h3>
<p>Well doing a paragraph is also easy just do < p > to make one</p>
<p>Trying to remeber it is also really easy jsut think p as paragraph</p>

<p>So the super basics are time to move on to a little more harder stuff</p>

<h3>Line Break</h3>
<p>First we start with the line break which look like <br> that which is cool ig? I already knew that ;-; </p>
<p>The way to remeber line break is br just think of br and break and it should be easy</p>

<h3>List</h3>
<p>Now we can move on to a list which is even cooler! The way to make a list looks like < ul > and make sure to add < li > in them and end with < /li > and after </ul> (Ex:) </p>

<ul>
  <li>Bread</li>
  <li>Cheese</li>
  <li>Meat</li>
  <li>Bread</li>
</ul>

<h3>Diffrent Fonts Basic</h3>
<p>Their are so many fonts like Italics, Bold, Times New Romans lol their is a basic and advanced first we do basic!</p>
<ul>
  <li>First Off we have Itaclis its done by putting < i > (EX:<i>Italics</i>)</li>
  <li>Next we have bold done by putting < b > (EX:<b>Bold</b>)</li>
  <li>Again "next" we have big that is done by < big > (EX:<big>Big</big>)</li>
  <li>In turn we have small that is done by putting < small > (EX:<small>small</small>)</li>
  <li>Now we have Strong < strong > (EX:<strong>Strong</strong>)</li>
  <li>Following its subscripted < sub > (EX:<sub>subscripted</sub></li>
  <li>Now theirs a version called Superscripted that is done < h3(or any other) >< sup > Ex:<h6><sup>superscripted text</sup></h6></li>
  <li>Next is Insterted < ins > (Ex:<ins>inserted text</ins>)</li>
  <li>Finally we have delted text < del > (Ex<del>deleted<del>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced Fonts</h3>
<p>Do I really want to add this? Its so much lines of code... I might just add it but as a example lol</p>
<p><html>
<head>
<style>
.p1 {
  font-family: "Times New Roman";
}

.p2 {
  font-family: "Arial";
}

.p3 {
  font-family: "Lucida Console";
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>CSS font-family</h1>
<p class="p1">This is a paragraph, shown in the Times New Roman font.</p>
<p class="p2">This is a paragraph, shown in the Arial font.</p>
<p class="p3">This is a paragraph, shown in the Lucida Console font.</p>

</body>
</html>
</p>

<h3>Inserting a Image</h3>
<p>Now even for me inserting a image is still kinda not that great at it lol but u need a png then do < img src="image.png" ><br>
<img src="file:///C:/Users/jespi/Downloads/ecd649d2b66cc88fae45d26d73c4d4cd.png">

<h3>Images Part 2</h3>
<p>Well you learned how to inseart a png lets now inseart a jpg and learn to change its size now.</p>
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
<p>Sometimes you send photos but are just to big or to small but you can resize them<br>
just do < img src="your jpg" alt="" width="number" height="number" > 

<h3>Instering Buttons</h3>
<p>Buttons are really simple infact! just put < button > and end with < /button > and their! (Ex:<button>Press Me</button>)</p>

<h3>Printing Button</h3>
<p>Now if you want the button do to something then u need it to alert for example

<button type="button" onclick="alert('Hello who ever is viewing this!')">Click Me!</button>

<p>Insane! ik lol but to do that you need to make a longer code ;-; ikr boring<br>lol but just put in < button type="button" on click="alert('What ever u want it to say')">Button Name</button>

<h3>Inputs</h3>
<p>Do you want to type on this file also? well here >> 
<input
type="text"
placeholder="Anything u want!" /></p>
<p>Now if you want to implant that in yours then knows its 3 lines of code so lets make a list 
<ul>
    <li>First line u need (< input)</li>
    <li>Next line (type="text")</li>
    <li>Final line (placeholder="put in what u want the box to say" / >)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Text Color</h3>
<p>Now lets learn how to change the color of the text, if you dont like it black the whole time.</p>
<p>Now lets say u like the color purple then it would look like this <span
    style="color:Purple">Purple!</span></p>
<p>Nice right? Well the code for that is 2 lines lets make a list agian!</br>
<ul>
    <li>First Code (< span)
    <li>Second Code (style="color:Color you want here">Word here</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>Inserting Links</h3>
<p>Yes as it says you can put a link into a text for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsxpqOLFnwbFQ8hKac0UdIQ">TheShowcaseYT</a> nice right? (Sub to me)</p>
<p>Well to do that its just 1 line of code, and that is < a href="Insert Link Here">Put the words here< /a > and boom try it out! </p>

<h3>DIV</h3>
<p>Well now we move on to div and that loooks like this: <head>
<style>
.myDiv {
  border: 5px outset red;
  background-color: lightblue;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="myDiv">
  <h2>This is a heading in a div element</h2>
  <p>This is some text in a div element.</p>
</div>

</body>

<p>Now to exexute that its a little harder even more me...</p>
<ul>
  <li>First line start with a head with < head > </li>
  <li>Line 2 put in . myDiv {
    border: "your px" "outset choose color";
    background-color: "any color"
    text-align: location of text;
  }
  < /style >
  < /head >
  < body > 

  < div class="MyDiv" >
    < h2 > you can put header here< /h >
