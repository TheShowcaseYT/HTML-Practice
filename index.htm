  <h1>Test HTML</h1>
  <p>So I am just testing this rn</p>

  </body>
</html>

<h3>Headers</h3>
<p>Headers are nice and simple u just put in < h > and end with < / h > no spaces!

<h3>Line Break</h3>
<p>First we start with the line break which look like <br> that which is cool ig? I already knew that ;-; </p>

<h3>List</h3>
<p>Now we can move on to a list which is even cooler! The way to make a list looks like < ul > and make sure to add < li > in them and end with < /li > and after </ul> (Ex:) </p>

<ul>
  <li>Bread</li>
  <li>Cheese</li>
  <li>Meat</li>
  <li>Bread</li>
</ul>

<h3>Diffrent Fonts Basic</h3>
<p>Their are so many fonts like Italics, Bold, Times New Romans lol their is a basic and advanced first we do basic!</p>
<ul>
  <li>First Off we have Itaclis its done by putting < i > (EX:<i>Italics</i>)</li>
  <li>Next we have bold done by putting < b > (EX:<b>Bold</b>)</li>
  <li>Again "next" we have big that is done by < big > (EX:<big>Big</big>)</li>
  <li>In turn we have small that is done by putting < small > (EX:<small>small</small>)<li>
  <li>Now we have Strong < strong > (EX:<strong>Strong</strong>)</li>
  <li>Following its subscripted < sub > (EX:<sub>subscripted</sub></li>
  <li>Now theirs a version called Superscripted that is done < h3(or any other) >< sup > (Ex:<h6><sup>superscripted text</sup></h6>)</li>
  <li>Next is Insterted < ins > (Ex:<ins>inserted text</ins>)</li>
  <li>Finally we have delted text < del > (Ex<del>deleted<del>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced Fonts</h3>
<p>Do I really want to add this? Its so much lines of code... I might just add it but as a example lol</p>
<p><html>
<head>
<style>
.p1 {
  font-family: "Times New Roman";
}

.p2 {
  font-family: Arial;
}

.p3 {
  font-family: "Lucida Console";
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>CSS font-family</h1>
<p class="p1">This is a paragraph, shown in the Times New Roman font.</p>
<p class="p2">This is a paragraph, shown in the Arial font.</p>
<p class="p3">This is a paragraph, shown in the Lucida Console font.</p>

</body>
</html>
</p>

<h3>Inserting a Image</h3>
<p>Now even for me inserting a image is still kinda not that great at it lol but u need a png then do < img src="image.png" ><br>
<img src="file:///C:/Users/jespi/OneDrive/Pictures/Screenshots/26785598.png">

<h3>Instering Buttons</h3>
<p>Buttons are really simple infact! just put < button > and end with < /button > and their! (Ex:<button>Press Me</button>)</p>

<h3>Printing Button</h3>
<p>Now if you want the button do to something then u need it to alert for example

<button type="button" onclick="alert('Hello who ever is viewing this!')">Click Me!</button>

<p>Insane! ik lol but to do that you need to make a longer code ;-; ikr boring<br>lol but just put in < button type="button" on click="alert('What ever u want it to say')">Button Name</button>

<h3>Inputs</h3>
<p>Do you want to type on this file also? well here >> 
<input
type="text"
placeholder="Anything u want!" /></p>
<p>Now if you want to implant that in yours then knows its 3 lines of code so lets make a list <ul>
                                                                                                    <li>First line u need (< input)</li>
                                                                                                    <li>Next line (type="text")</li>
                                                                                                    <li>Final line (placeholder="put in what u want the box to say" / >)</li>
<ul>

<h3>Text Color</h3>
<p>Now lets learn how to change the color of the text, if you dont like it black the whole time.</p>
<p>Now lets say u like the color purple then it would look like this <span
    style="color:Purple">Purple!</span></p>
<p>Nice right? Well the code for that is 2 lines lets make a list agian! <ul>
                                                                             <li>First Code (< span)
                                                                             <li>Second Code (style="color:Color you want here">Word here</span><li>
<ul></p>
